# downScale

**downScale** is a simple, user-friendly Windows desktop app for quickly reducing the size of your video files while keeping good visual quality. It is ideal for archiving, sharing, or saving storage space on personal and family videos.

## What does it do?
- Shrinks large video files by converting them to efficient formats (H.264 or H.265)
- Automatically scales videos to fit within 1920×1920 pixels, preserving the original aspect ratio
- Lets you process multiple videos at once (batch conversion)
- Plays a short audio notification when each conversion finishes (if a .wav file is present)
- Keeps a log of your conversions for easy review

## How to use
1. **Prepare your videos**: Place the video files you want to compress anywhere on your computer.
2. **Run the app**: Start `downScaleApp.exe` from the app folder.
3. **Select videos**: Drag and drop video files onto the app or run from the command line with file paths as arguments.
4. **Choose output location**: The app suggests a default folder on your Desktop, or you can enter a different full path.
5. **Pick a quality preset**: Choose from several options balancing file size and quality.
6. **(Optional) Test audio**: If an audio file is found, you can test-play it before starting.
7. **Start conversion**: The app will process each video, showing progress and playing a sound when done.
8. **Find your files**: Converted videos appear in your chosen output folder, ready to use or share.
